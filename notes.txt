PROBLEMS: 

- Cannot enter anything else but numbers, but user should be able to enter whatever he likes. 
  Solved. Reason: input field is type="number" 

- Countdown starts again after game over, when there is an input in the input field
  Solved. Timer is set to null only on click on 'restart game' button, not after game over.
  
- Countdown starts by itself after clikcing restart button:
  Input field is in focus. Coountdown starts upon ANY keydown event on input field. Event if I change to another browser window and change back using Alt+Tab
  Solved: Only react to number keys

- Countdown should show 0 BEFORE alert
  Could not solve the problem as long as I was using alert.
  I chose to display 'game over' in place of the math question, once the user loses.

- Countdown should always or never show word 'seconds'.
  Solved: I went for showing 'seconds' before the game, to make it clear to the user. But to then let the countdown run without showing 'seconds'.

- The countdown does not reflect the added time. The current time left just remains there one second longer, but it should actually show the added second. The countdown seems to pause while user enters correct solution. Is the second even added?
  Solved: The second was added, but the display was not updated after adding the second. Added line that updates display.


QUESTIONS:  
/*
Could I write this as a recursive function?
function game:
// Stopping condition:
  if timeLeft === 0:
    display 'game over'
// Function call
  else:
    Generate question
      If userInput === correct answer:
        userScore++
        timeLeft++
